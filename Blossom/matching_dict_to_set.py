    Converts a dictionary representing a matching (as returned by
    :func:`max_weight_matching`) to a set representing a matching (as
    returned by :func:`maximal_matching`).

    In the definition of maximal matching adopted by NetworkX,
    self-loops are not allowed, so the provided dictionary is expected
    to never have any mapping from a key to itself. However, the
    dictionary is expected to have mirrored key/value pairs, for
    example, key ``u`` with value ``v`` and key ``v`` with value ``u``.
